# Capstone_Project_Starbucks
This is an end to end machine learning project. It provides the idea how we can understand the customer transaction behavior depending upon the demographic data analysis. In this project, we had three datasets from Starbucks. The first dataset provides the information of offer types, reward for completing an offer. It also provides the duration how far the offer will be open and minimum requirements for the completion of the offer. It also provides the customers communication methods. The second dataset is related to the demographic information of the customers. It provides the age, income, gender of the customers. It also gives the time when the customer created the app accounts. The third dataset provides the transaction history. It allows the descriptions of offer received, viewed and completed. It also provides the amount how much is spent for the transaction. These three datasets are very helpful to analyze the whole transaction behavior. This project is to build a machine learning model to predict the customer response depending on the demographic data of the customer.

## Project Motivation
This project follows the following guidances:
- Understanding the business by looking at the data
- Exploratory Data Analysis and visualization
- Cleaning Data
- Feature selection and scaling
- Building Machine Learning model
- Evaluating the model

## Discussion
After completing this project, I understand how we can process data and build an end to end machine learning model and evaluate the model.
